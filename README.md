LIFE Healthy Forest
===================

This study was funded by the [EU LIFE Healthy Forest (LIFE14 ENV/ES/000179)](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=5219) project.

The setup of this benchmark study is described below. In total, 140 performance estimates have been calculated.

#### Classifiers (7)

-   BRT (Boosted Regression Trees)
-   GAM (Generalized Additive Model)
-   GLM (Generalized Linear Model)
-   KNN (k-nearest Neighbor)
-   SVM (Support Vector Machine)
-   RF (Random Forest)
-   XGBOOST (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

#### Datasets (4)

-   Armillaria
-   Diplodia
-   Fusarium
-   Heterobasidion

#### Resampling structures (5)

(performance estimation / hyperparameter tuning)

-   Spatial/non-spatial
-   Spatial/Spatial
-   Spatial/No tuning
-   Non-spatial/Non-spatial
-   Non-spatial/No tuning

Hyperparameter tuning
---------------------

Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO)

Initial design: 30 settings Maximum iterations: 100

Resampling
----------

Nested cross-validation with five folds in both levels and 100 repetitions (performance level).

Performance measure
-------------------

Brier score

Pathogens "Diplodia" and "Fusarium" have the additional variables "age" and "year" during benchmarking compared to "Armillaria" and "Heterobasidion" for which these variables were not available.

Both variables are not used for prediction as they would not be known in a predictive situation.

Prediction
----------

Probability of occurence for the specific pathogen across the whole Basque country on a 200 x 200 m spatial resolution.

#### External library requirements

-   SAGA GIS (for creating the input variable `slope_degrees`)

Data
----

Stored at [Mendeley Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kmy95t22fy.1). Data **(~ 4 GB)** will be downloaded into `data/` and processed when executing the project. Local storage directory is "./data".

Workflow
--------

This project is setup with a [drake workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), ensuring reproducibility. Intermediate targets/objects will be stored in a hidden `.drake` directory.

The R library of this project is managed by [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/). This makes sure that the exact same package versions are used when recreating the project. When calling `packrat::restore()`, all required packages will be installed with their specific version.

Please note that this project was built with R version 3.5.1 on a Debian 9 operating system. The packrat packages from this project **are not compatible with R versions prior version 3.5.0.** For reproducibility, it is recommended to replicate the analysis using the included Dockerfile. Instructions can be found [Ä§ere](https://github.com/pat-s/pathogen-modeling#docker). (In general, it should be possible to reproduce the analysis on any other operating system.)

To clone the project, a working installation of `git` is required. Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and execute:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:pat-s/pathogen-modeling.git
```

Then start R in this directory and run

``` r
packrat::restore()
source("code/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file = stdout()) 
# use more cores with make(plan, jobs = <number of cores>)
```

Runtime
-------

Predicted total runtime (based on all target runtimes ever built and stored in the internal `config` file)

``` r
source("code/drake.R")
predict_runtime(config, from_scratch = TRUE, targets_only = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning: Some targets were never actually timed, And no hypothetical time was specified in `known_times`. Assuming a runtime of 0 for these targets:
    ##   lrn_gam_diplodia_perf
    ##   lrn_gam_diplodia_pred
    ##   lrn_gam_fusarium_perf
    ##   lrn_gam_fusarium_pred
    ##   lrn_gam_armillaria_pred
    ##   lrn_gam_heterobasidion_perf
    ##   lrn_gam_heterobasidion_pred

    ##   ...

Acceleration when parallelizing the `make()` call

``` r
time <- c()
for (jobs in 1:10){
  time[jobs] <- predict_runtime(
    drake_config(),
    jobs = jobs,
    from_scratch = TRUE,
    known_times = build_times(targets_only = TRUE)$elapsed
  )
}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(time = time / 3600, jobs = ordered(1:10), group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = jobs, y = time, group = group)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:10 * 4, limits = c(0, 29)) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubr() +
  xlab("jobs argument of make()") +
  ylab("Predicted runtime of make() (hours)")
```

Docker
------

A Dockerfile is available in `docker/`. It was generated by the R package [`containerit`](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and contains all packrat packages and system libraries with have been used to run the analysis (the file already exists, no need to do this).

``` r
remotes::install_github("pat-s/containerit@packrat")
library(containerit)
container = dockerfile(".", packrat = TRUE)
write(container, "docker/Dockerfile")
```

A docker container can be built and started from this Dockerfile by executing `docker build -t image .` within the `./docker` directory.

Next, the analysis can be started by calling

``` r
source("code/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file = stdout()) 
```

Dependency graphs
-----------------

The dependency graph of this analysis can be visualized with the following code. The grouping via the `"stage"` variable is subjective.

The following groups exist:

-   data
-   learner
-   mlr\_settings
-   benchmark
-   prediction
