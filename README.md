# LIFE Healthy Forest

Benchmarking classifiers (SVM, RF, XGBOOST) on four different pathogens:

* Armillaria
* Diplodia
* Heterobasidion
* Fusarium

## Hyperparameter tuning: 

Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO)

## Data

Stored at [Mendeley Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kmy95t22fy.1).
Data will be downloaded and processed when executing the project.
Local storage directory is "./data".
After the intermediate R objects have been created, the data is deleted again to only function as a starting point and keep the directoy small.
Only raster files need be kept as raster processes require a file stored on disk.

## Workflow

This project is setup with a [drake workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), ensuring reproducibility.
Intermediate targets/objects will be stored in a hidden `.drake` directory.

The R library of this project is managed by [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).
This makes sure that the exact same package versions are used when recreating the project.
When calling `packrat::restore()`, all required packages will be installed with their specific version.

Please note that this project was built with R version 3.5.1 on a Debian 9 operating system.
The packrat packages from this project **are not compatible with R versions prior version 3.5.0.**
For reproducibility, we recommend to replicate the analysis using the included Dockerfile.
Instructions can be found [Ä§ere](https://venus.geogr.uni-jena.de/bi28yuv/pathogen-modelling#docker).
However, it should be possible to reproduce the analysis on any other operating system.

To clone the project, a working installation of `git` is required.
Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and execute:

```sh
git clone https://venus.geogr.uni-jena.de/bi28yuv/pathogen-modelling
```

Then open a R session in this directory and run

```r
packrat::restore()
source("scripts/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file=stdout()) 
# use more cores with make(plan, jobs = <number of cores>)
```

## Docker

A Dockerfile is available in `docker/`.
It was generated by the R package [`containerit`](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and contains all packrat packages and system libraries with have been used to run the analysis (the file already exists, no need to do this). 

```r
remotes::install_github("pat-s/containerit@packrat")
library(containerit)
container = dockerfile(".", packrat = TRUE)
write(container, "docker/Dockerfile")
```

A docker container can be built and started from this Dockerfile by executing `docker build -t image .` within the `./docker` directory.

Next, the analysis can be started by calling

```r
source("scripts/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file=stdout()) 
```

## Dependency graphs

The dependency graph of this analysis (subjective grouping) can be visualized with the following code.

Note that intermediate files have been gathered into the following categories:

- Data
- Task
- Learner
- mlr_settings
- benchmark
- prediction

```r
vis_drake_graph(config, group = "stage", clusters = c("task", "learner", "data"
                                                      "mlr_settings",
                                                      "benchmark",
                                                      "prediction"),
                targets_only = TRUE, show_output_files = FALSE)
```

If all intermediate objects should be visualized (not recommended):

```r
vis_drake_graph(config)
```
