# LIFE Healthy Forest

This study was funded by the [EU LIFE Healthy Forest (LIFE14 ENV/ES/000179)](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=5219) project.

The setup of this benchmark study is described below. 
In total, 140 performance estimates have been calculated.

#### Classifiers (7)

- BRT (Boosted Regression Trees)
- GAM (Generalized Additive Model)
- GLM (Generalized Linear Model)
- KNN (k-nearest Neighbor)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- RF (Random Forest)
- XGBOOST (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

#### Datasets (4)

- Armillaria
- Diplodia
- Fusarium
- Heterobasidion

#### Resampling structures (5)

<performance estimation>/<hyperparameter tuning>

- Spatial/non-spatial
- Spatial/Spatial
- Spatial/No tuning
- Non-spatial/Non-spatial
- Non-spatial/No tuning

## Hyperparameter tuning: 

Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO)

Initial design: 30 settings
Maximum iterations: 100

## Performance measure

Brier score

## Prediction

Probability of occurence for the specific pathogen across the whole Basque country on a 200 x 200 m spatial resolution.

## Data

Stored at [Mendeley Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/kmy95t22fy.1).
Data **(~ 4 GB)** will be downloaded and processed when executing the project.
Local storage directory is "./data".
After the intermediate R objects have been created, the data is deleted again to only function as a starting point and keep the directoy small.
Only raster files need be kept as raster processes require a file stored on disk.

## Workflow

This project is setup with a [drake workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), ensuring reproducibility.
Intermediate targets/objects will be stored in a hidden `.drake` directory.

The R library of this project is managed by [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).
This makes sure that the exact same package versions are used when recreating the project.
When calling `packrat::restore()`, all required packages will be installed with their specific version.

Please note that this project was built with R version 3.5.1 on a Debian 9 operating system.
The packrat packages from this project **are not compatible with R versions prior version 3.5.0.**
For reproducibility, we recommend to replicate the analysis using the included Dockerfile.
Instructions can be found [Ä§ere](https://venus.geogr.uni-jena.de/bi28yuv/pathogen-modelling#docker).
However, it should be possible to reproduce the analysis on any other operating system.

To clone the project, a working installation of `git` is required.
Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and execute:

```sh
git clone https://venus.geogr.uni-jena.de/bi28yuv/pathogen-modelling
```

Then open a R session in this directory and run

```{r eval = FALSE}
packrat::restore()
source("code/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file=stdout()) 
# use more cores with make(plan, jobs = <number of cores>)
```

## Runtime

Predicted total runtime

```{r}
source("code/drake.R")
predict_runtime(drake_config(), from_scratch = TRUE, targets_only = TRUE)
```

Acceleration by parallelization of `make()` call

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
time <- c()
for (jobs in 1:10){
  time[jobs] <- predict_runtime(
    drake_config(),
    jobs = jobs,
    from_scratch = TRUE,
    known_times = build_times(targets_only = TRUE)$elapsed
  )
}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(time = time / 3600, jobs = ordered(1:10), group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = jobs, y = time, group = group)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:10 * 4, limits = c(0, 29)) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubr() +
  xlab("jobs argument of make()") +
  ylab("Predicted runtime of make() (hours)")
```

## Docker

A Dockerfile is available in `docker/`.
It was generated by the R package [`containerit`](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and contains all packrat packages and system libraries with have been used to run the analysis (the file already exists, no need to do this). 

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("pat-s/containerit@packrat")
library(containerit)
container = dockerfile(".", packrat = TRUE)
write(container, "docker/Dockerfile")
```

A docker container can be built and started from this Dockerfile by executing `docker build -t image .` within the `./docker` directory.

Next, the analysis can be started by calling

```{r eval = FALSE}
source("code/drake.R")
make(plan, keep_going = TRUE, console_log_file = stdout()) 
```

## Dependency graphs

The dependency graph of this analysis (subjective grouping) can be visualized with the following code.

Note that intermediate files have been gathered into the following categories:

- Data
- Task
- Learner
- mlr_settings
- benchmark
- prediction

```{r, results='hide'}
vis_drake_graph(drake_config(), group = "stage", clusters = c("data", "prediction",
                                                              "mlr_settings"),
                targets_only = TRUE, show_output_files = FALSE,
                navigationButtons = FALSE, selfcontained = TRUE,
                file = "drake.png") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubr()
```

![](./drake.png)

If all intermediate objects should be visualized (not recommended):

```{r eval = FALSE}
vis_drake_graph(drake_config()) + ggpubr::theme_pubr()
```
